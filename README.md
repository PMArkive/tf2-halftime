### simple, from scratch halftime plugin for 5cp and koth
Hi. This is a plugin that emulates ESEA style halftimes for 5cp (halftime at 3 points or timelimit) and king of the hill (halftime at 2 points) modes in competitive tf2. I got very tired of dealing with having to reexec configs for rgl 6s matches on koth and 5cp maps, so I wrote this plugin. I am aware that other plugins (like [compctl](https://github.com/fwdcp/CompCtrl)) exist, but they are bloated and/or unmaintained. It is included in the official [RGL Server Resources repository](https://github.com/stephanieLGBT/rgl-server-resources), do not download it from here.
